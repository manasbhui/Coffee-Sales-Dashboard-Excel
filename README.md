☕ Case Study: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis 📊

I recently completed an insightful project analyzing the sales performance of a coffee shop across multiple locations. The objective was to understand key trends, customer behavior, and product preferences to help drive strategic decision-making for business growth.

🔍 Objective: The analysis involved examining sales data, customer footfall, and order trends across various store locations, revealing actionable insights to optimize sales and improve customer experience.

💼 Approach: Using MS Excel 2019, I built a dynamic dashboard to uncover insights through data visualization:

Footfall Analysis: Analyzed peak hours, footfall patterns across locations, and order trends by day of the week.
Product Performance: Evaluated top-selling products and category sales distribution to identify customer preferences.
Order Insights: Assessed order sizes to understand customer choices and sales contributions by different drink sizes.
Sales Trends: Tracked hourly sales trends to pinpoint high-demand periods for better inventory and staff planning.
The findings will help guide targeted promotions, optimize inventory management, and enhance the overall customer experience. 🏆

Check out the dashboard for key insights and recommendations. 🚀
